### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is J.P. and I'm a junior at the University of Denver, studying for a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science! I'm also a Software Engineer Intern for Lockheed Martin on the Peace Krypton project.

## Current Projects ðŸ”­
Aside from my academics, I am working on a few personal projects that will hopefully benefit others. One of these projects is a tech startup that I founded called Harvester, which helps small brick-and-mortar businesses get their inventories more exposure on the internet. If you're interested in helping with the projectâ€”because I sure could use a few extra handsâ€”contact me via any method below!
